DESCRIPTION

    NPL is an revolutionary programming language architecture design. 
    
    Software written in NPL will be automatically splitet at run time into
    multiple threads by it's virtual machine. Synchronization between threads 
    are highly optimized and reduced to a minium, which is strongly required for
    Grid Computing and Supercomputers.

    By design, virtual machines for NPL do not need a Garbage Collector and 
    memory also do not needed to be delete manualy. At load/compile time it is
    already known when to deleted memory, which allows a new way of memory 
    handling.

    The project provides severals components:

    virtual machine (in development)
    assembler (in development)
    disassembler (in development)
    linker (not started yet)
    compiler (not started yet)
    decompiler (not started yet)
    optimizer (not started yet)
    profiler (not started yet)
    build system (not started yet)
    debugger (not started yet)


PLATFORM

    To build the source code C compiler (C99 compatible) and Make is required.

    The virtual machine will only work under x86 (IA-32) compatible processor.
    Other platforms will follow. NX-Bit, PaX, Exec Shield and/or other such 
    security features must be disabled.

    All software is tested under GNU/Linux Systems.


BUILD

    For building the software execute the following commands in a shell

    $git clone http://github.com/Anz/npl.git npl
    $make
